- ğŸ”­ I am currently a senior at BYU studying statistics. I decided to study statistics because at its core, statistics is really the study of understanding data. Data can tell an infinite amount of stories, and I ensure that the correct stories are being told in ways that anyone can understand them. People often say that we live in the information age, but I feel that we live more in the data age. I love leveraging that data to create information that can help businesses and individuals make smart decisions
- ğŸŒ± This page contains different school and personal projects that I'm working in related to statistics and data science
